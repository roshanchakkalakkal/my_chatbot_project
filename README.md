# my_chatbot_project

## My First Document Chatbot (Open Source Edition): Step-by-Step for Beginners
This project will teach you how to build a basic AI chatbot that can "read" your documents and answer questions about them.
What we're building: Imagine you have a folder full of your notes, reports, or recipes. Instead of searching manually, you can ask this chatbot questions like, "What are the main ingredients for the chocolate cake?" or "Summarize the key points of the 'Q2 Earnings Report.pdf'." The chatbot will find the answer within your files!
Key Idea: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This is the fancy name for what we're doing. Think of it like this:
1. Retrieval: The chatbot first looks up relevant information from your documents, like a super-fast librarian finding the right books.
1. Augmented: It then adds this found information to your question.
1. Generation: Finally, it uses a powerful AI model (a "Large Language Model") to generate a human-like answer based on your question AND the retrieved information. This helps the AI stay accurate and not just make things up.

## Step 0: Setting Up Your Computer for Python (The Foundation)
Before we write any AI code, we need to get your computer ready to understand and run Python. Python is like the language we'll use to tell the computer what to do.

### 0.1. Installing Python:
•	What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It's known for being relatively easy to read and write, which makes it great for beginners. Think of it as teaching your computer a new language so you can give it instructions.

•	Why do we need it? All the tools and libraries we'll use (LangChain, Streamlit, etc.) are written in Python. So, your computer needs Python installed to run them.

#### How to Install (Choose your operating system):
##### For Windows:
1.	Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2.	Go to the official Python download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3.	Look for the latest "Python 3.x.x" version (e.g., Python 3.12.3). Click the "Download Python 3.x.x" button. This will download an executable file (a .exe file).
4.	Find the downloaded .exe file (usually in your "Downloads" folder) and double-click it to start the installer.
5.	VERY IMPORTANT STEP: In the first installer window, you'll see checkboxes at the bottom. MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE BOX that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (or similar wording). This is super important because it tells your computer where to find Python commands, making it easier to use in the future.
6.	Then, click "Install Now" and follow any prompts. It might ask for administrator permission; click "Yes."
7.	Once finished, you might see a screen saying "Setup was successful." Click "Close."
##### For macOS:
1.	Open your Terminal application. You can find it by searching "Terminal" in Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Terminal").
2.	Install Homebrew: Homebrew is a "package manager" for macOS, which makes installing other software (like Python) much easier. Paste this command into your Terminal and press Enter:

        Bash
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  	
Follow any on-screen instructions (you might need to press Enter or type your computer's password).

3.	Install Python using Homebrew: Once Homebrew is installed, paste this command into your Terminal and press Enter:

  	    Bash
  	    brew install python
       
This will download and install the latest Python 3 version.
##### For Linux (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian):
1.	Open your Terminal.
2.	First, update your computer's list of available software:

        Bash
        sudo apt update
  	
(You might need to enter your computer's password).
3.	Then, install Python 3 and pip (which we'll use to install other Python tools):

        Bash
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
        
### 0.2. Verifying Your Python Installation:
•	This step confirms that Python is correctly installed and your computer can find it.

•	Open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows - search for cmd in the Start Menu).

•	Type these commands one by one and press Enter after each:

        Bash
        python --version
        python3 --version
        pip --version
        pip3 --version

•	What to look for: You should see something like Python 3.10.12 or similar, and pip followed by a version number. If one command doesn't work (e.g., python --version says "command not found"), try the other (e.g., python3 --version). For pip, usually pip works, but sometimes pip3 is necessary. The key is that at least one of each (python and pip) gives you a version number.

### 0.3. Creating Your Project Folder:
•	It's good practice to keep all files related to a project in one organized folder.

•	Go to a place on your computer where you like to keep your projects (e.g., your Desktop, Documents, or create a new folder called Projects).

•	Create a new folder and name it my_chatbot_project.

•	Inside my_chatbot_project, create another new folder and name it my_documents. This is where you'll put the actual files that your chatbot will learn from.
Your folder structure should look like this (like a nested set of boxes):

        my_chatbot_project/  <-- This is your main project box
        └── my_documents/    <-- This inner box holds your text files, PDFs, etc.

### 0.4. Getting a Code Editor (VS Code Recommended):
•	What is a Code Editor? It's like a specialized word processor for writing computer code. It helps you by coloring code, suggesting completions, and catching errors, making coding much easier.

•	Why VS Code? Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is free, very popular, and has many helpful features for Python development.

•	How to get it:

1.	Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2.	Download and install it like any other software on your computer.
3.	Open your my_chatbot_project folder in VS Code:
4.	Launch VS Code.
5.	Go to File menu (top left) > Open Folder....
6.	Navigate to your my_chatbot_project folder and click "Select Folder."

### 0.5. Creating a Virtual Environment (A Python Best Practice!):
•	What is a Virtual Environment? Imagine you're building different projects, and each project needs specific tools. If all tools were dumped into one big toolbox (your main Python installation), things could get messy. A virtual environment is like creating a separate, isolated toolbox just for this specific project.

•	Why use it? It prevents conflicts. If Project A needs Tool v1 and Project B needs Tool v2, a virtual environment lets them coexist happily without breaking each other.

•	How to create and activate:

1.	Open the Terminal in VS Code: In VS Code, go to the Terminal menu (at the top) > New Terminal. This opens a terminal panel at the bottom of VS Code, and it will automatically be "inside" your my_chatbot_project folder.
2.	Create the virtual environment: In the VS Code terminal, type this command and press Enter:
        Bash
        python -m venv venv
This creates a new subfolder named venv inside your my_chatbot_project folder. This venv folder contains all the isolated Python stuff for this project.
3.	Activate the virtual environment: This tells your terminal to use the tools from this project's specific toolbox.

#### For Windows (in VS Code's terminal):

        Bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate

If any error like “Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies” check running below command

        get-ExecutionPolicy

If its not “Unrestricted”, run command to update the same 

        Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
        
Both the commands can be executed from VS Code terminal itself

##### For macOS/Linux (in VS Code's terminal):

        Bash
        source venv/bin/activate

4.	Verify Activation: You'll know it's active when you see (venv) appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt. For example: (venv) C:\my_chatbot_project>.
From now on, always make sure (venv) is visible in your terminal before running any commands for this project!

## Step 1: Install and Set Up Ollama (Your Local AI Brain)
Since we're going with free and open-source, Ollama is our star. It makes it super easy to run powerful AI models right on your own computer.

•	What is Ollama? 

Ollama is like a friendly assistant that helps you download, manage, and run large language models (LLMs) directly on your computer. Instead of sending your data to a company's servers to be processed by their AI, Ollama lets you keep everything local and private. It simplifies a lot of complex technical stuff.

### 1.1. Download and Install Ollama:
1.	Open your web browser and go to the official Ollama website: https://ollama.com/download
2.	Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3.	Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Ollama. It typically installs itself as a background service, meaning it runs quietly in the background, ready when you need it.

### 1.2. Download an LLM (Large Language Model) using Ollama:

#### What is an LLM? 

An LLM (Large Language Model) is the "brain" of our chatbot. It's a type of AI that has been trained on a massive amount of text from the internet (books, articles, websites, etc.). This training allows it to understand and generate human-like text, answer questions, summarize, translate, and much more. Think of it as having read almost everything on the internet.

#### Why download one? 

The models are large files (several gigabytes), so we need to download one that Ollama can use.

#### How to download:

1.	Open a new Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows). This is your system's terminal, not necessarily the one inside VS Code, as Ollama runs independently.
2.	Type the following command and press Enter:

        Bash
        ollama run llama3
  	
3.	ollama run llama3 explained:

  	**ollama:** This is the command to tell the Ollama program to do something.

  	**run:** This tells Ollama to start a model.

  	**llama3:** This is the name of the specific LLM we want to use. Llama 3 is a powerful, open-source model developed by         Meta (Facebook's parent company). It's a good balance of capability and size for getting started.

  	**What happens next:** Ollama will start downloading the llama3 model. This will show you progress like pulling manifest, pulling ... layers. This can take quite a while, depending on your internet speed, as the model is large (around 4.7 GB).
  	
  	**Once downloaded:** After the download is complete, Ollama will automatically start an interactive chat session with the llama3 model. You'll see a prompt where you can type. You can type hi and press Enter to test it.

  	**Exit the session:** Type /bye and press Enter to exit the interactive chat.
4.	Keep Ollama running: After you exit the interactive session, the Ollama server usually continues to run in the background. This is important because our Python code will connect to this running server to use the llama3 model.

## Step 2: Install Necessary Python Libraries (Our AI Tools)
Now we'll install the specific Python "tools" (libraries) that our chatbot code needs to function. These are like specialized toolkits for Python.
### Why install them? 
Python itself is just the language. These libraries add extra capabilities, like reading PDFs, doing smart text searches, and connecting to AI models.
### How to install:
1.	Go back to your VS Code terminal.
2.	Make sure your virtual environment is active! (You should see (venv) at the beginning of the prompt). If not, activate it again (refer to Step 0.5).
3.	Type the following command and press Enter:
   
        Bash
        pip install langchain-community langchain-huggingface faiss-cpu pypdf streamlit
  	
#### What each library does:

**langchain-community:** This is part of the "LangChain" framework. LangChain is like a master toolbox for building applications with LLMs. This specific part has tools for loading documents and working with vector stores (more on these soon!).

**langchain-huggingface:** This connects LangChain to models available through Hugging Face. We'll use it to connect to Ollama (for our LLM) and to download a local embedding model (more on embeddings next!).

**faiss-cpu:** This is Facebook AI Similarity Search. It's an incredibly fast library that helps us search through huge amounts of numerical data (our "embeddings") to find things that are "similar." It's our "vector store" for quick lookups. The -cpu part means it uses your computer's main processor (CPU), not a specialized graphics card (GPU).

**pypdf:** This library is specifically for reading and extracting text from PDF files.

**streamlit:** This library makes it incredibly easy to turn our Python code into a simple, interactive web application (our chatbot's user interface). You don't need to know web design; Streamlit handles it all!

## Step 3: Prepare Your Documents (The Chatbot's Knowledge Base)
This is where you give your chatbot the information it will learn from.
### What to do:
1.	Go to the my_documents folder you created inside your my_chatbot_project folder.
2.	Place some documents inside this folder. You can use:

  	.txt files (simple text files)

  	.pdf files (Portable Document Format)

  	You can even create subfolders within my_documents (e.g., my_documents/recipes/, my_documents/reports/) – the chatbot will look in those too!
  	
#### Examples of what you could put:
	A .txt file with your class notes.
	A PDF of a user manual for a gadget.
	A document summarizing a project.
	A collection of articles you're interested in.

## Step 4: Write the Chatbot Code (The Brains of the Operation)
Now we'll write the Python code that puts all these pieces together.

### Where to write it: 
In VS Code, open the app.py file that you should have created in my_chatbot_project. If you haven't, right-click in the Explorer panel (left side of VS Code), select "New File," and name it app.py.

Copy and paste the entire code provided in the in the app.py file.

Let's break down that code section by section:

        Python
        import streamlit as st
        import os

        #LangChain components for document processing and QA
        from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, TextLoader, PyPDFLoader
        from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
        from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings, ChatOllama # Updated imports for local models
        from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
        from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
        from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
#### import ...: 
These lines are like saying, "Hey Python, I'm going to use tools from these specific toolboxes (libraries)." Each import brings in a set of related functions.

**streamlit as st:** Imports the Streamlit library and gives it a shorter name st for convenience.

**os:** This is a built-in Python library that helps us interact with your computer's operating system, like checking if a folder exists.

**The langchain_...** imports bring in specific parts of the LangChain framework for loading documents, splitting text, creating embeddings, connecting to Ollama, and building the "chain" that links everything together.

        Python
        # --- Configuration ---
        DOCUMENTS_FOLDER = "./my_documents"
        OLLAMA_MODEL = "llama3" # Ensure you have downloaded this model via `ollama run llama3`
        EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" # A good, small, fast embedding model
        CHUNK_SIZE = 1000
        CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200
        TEMPERATURE = 0.7 # Controls creativity of LLM (0.0 for factual, higher for more creative)
**DOCUMENTS_FOLDER = "./my_documents":** This tells our code where to find your documents. ./ means "in the same folder as this app.py file."

**OLLAMA_MODEL = "llama3":** This is the name of the LLM you downloaded with Ollama (in Step 1.2). If you downloaded a different model (e.g., mistral), you would change this line.

**EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2":** This is the specific "embedding model" we'll use.

**What is an Embedding Model?** Imagine every word or sentence has a "meaning." An embedding model converts this meaning into a list of numbers (a "vector"). Sentences with similar meanings will have vectors that are "close" to each other in a mathematical sense.
        
**Why do we need it?** When you ask a question, your question also gets turned into an embedding. Then, we can quickly search your documents' embeddings to find which parts of your documents have meanings similar to your question. This is much smarter than just searching for keywords.
        
"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" is a specific, widely used, and efficient model from a collection called "sentence-transformers" on Hugging Face. Hugging Face is a huge hub for open-source AI models.
        
**CHUNK_SIZE = 1000 & CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200:**

**What is Chunking?** Large documents (like a 100-page PDF) are too big for LLMs to read all at once. So, we break them into smaller, manageable "chunks" or "pieces." CHUNK_SIZE is roughly how many characters each piece will be.

**What is Chunk Overlap?** Imagine breaking a sentence: "The cat sat on the mat. It was a fluffy cat." If you chunked perfectly in the middle, "mat" and "It" might be in different chunks. CHUNK_OVERLAP means we'll add a little bit of the end of one chunk to the beginning of the next. This helps ensure that important information isn't accidentally cut off at the edges of a chunk, maintaining context.

**TEMPERATURE = 0.7:** This setting controls how "creative" or "random" the LLM's answers are.
0.0 means the most factual, least creative answer (always trying to give the most likely word).
Higher values (like 0.7 or 1.0) make the answers more varied and potentially more imaginative, but can also sometimes lead to less factual or "hallucinated" answers. For a Q&A system, 0.7 is a good balance.

        Python
        # --- Streamlit UI ---
        st.set_page_config(page_title="My Local Document Chatbot", layout="wide")
        st.title("📚 My Local Document Chatbot (Open Source)")
        st.markdown(f"""
        Ask me questions about the documents in your `{DOCUMENTS_FOLDER}` folder!
        Using **Ollama ({OLLAMA_MODEL})** for answers and **Hugging Face ({EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME})** for document understanding.
        """)

**st.set_page_config(...):** Configures how your web page looks (title, layout).
**st.title(...):** Displays a big title on your web page.
**st.markdown(...):** Displays formatted text (like notes or explanations) on your web page.

        Python
        # --- Check Ollama Server Status ---
        def check_ollama_status():
            try:
                import requests
                requests.get("http://localhost:11434/api/tags", timeout=1)
                return True
            except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
                return False
            except Exception as e:
                st.error(f"Error checking Ollama status: {e}")
                return False
        
        if not check_ollama_status():
            st.error("Ollama server is not running or not accessible. Please ensure Ollama is installed and running.")
            st.markdown("You can download Ollama from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download).")
            st.markdown(f"After installing, run `ollama run {OLLAMA_MODEL}` in your terminal to download the model and start the server.")
            st.stop() # Stop the Streamlit app if Ollama isn't running
            
**check_ollama_status() function:** This is a small helper function.
It tries to quickly connect to the Ollama server (which usually runs on http://localhost:11434).

If it can connect, it means Ollama is running, which is good!

If it can't connect, it shows an error message in your web app and tells you what to do (like making sure Ollama is installed and running ollama run llama3). This is important because the whole chatbot depends on Ollama being available.

st.stop(): If Ollama isn't found, the app stops to prevent further errors.

•	@st.cache_resource: This is a special Streamlit command. It tells Streamlit, "Run this load_and_process_documents function only once when the app first starts. After that, remember its results. If the app restarts or changes slightly, don't re-run this whole long process unless something major changes (like the function's code or its inputs)." This makes your app much faster after the initial setup.
•	load_and_process_documents(folder_path, embedding_model_name): This function does the heavy lifting of getting your documents ready for the AI.
o	1. Load Documents:
	loader_mapping: This is a "dictionary" that tells LangChain which "loader" to use for each file type (e.g., use TextLoader for .txt files, PyPDFLoader for .pdf files).
	DirectoryLoader: This tool scans your DOCUMENTS_FOLDER (and its subfolders because recursive=True) and uses the correct loader_class to read the content of each file. It converts the files into a format that LangChain can work with.
	all_documents.extend(loaded_docs): Gathers all the loaded content into one big list.
o	2. Split Documents into Chunks:
	RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: This tool takes the loaded documents and breaks them into smaller pieces (chunks) according to your CHUNK_SIZE and CHUNK_OVERLAP settings. It tries to split intelligently, often by paragraphs or sentences first.
o	3. Create Embeddings and Store in Vector Store:
	HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=embedding_model_name): This is where your chosen embedding model (e.g., "all-MiniLM-L6-v2") is loaded. The first time this runs, it will download the actual embedding model files from Hugging Face to your computer.
	FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings): This is a crucial step!
	It takes each chunk of text.
	It uses the embeddings model to convert that text chunk into its numerical "fingerprint" (vector).
	It then stores all these numerical fingerprints (vectors) in a special database called a Vector Store (FAISS in our case).
	What is a Vector Store? Imagine a giant digital space where every text chunk's "meaning-fingerprint" (embedding) is placed. Similar meanings are placed close together. A vector store is a super-fast way to store these millions of fingerprints and, more importantly, to quickly find all the fingerprints that are mathematically "close" to a given query's fingerprint. This is how we find relevant document parts.
	st.spinner(...) and st.success(...): These are Streamlit commands to show you what's happening (a spinning circle while working, then a success message).

•	if not os.path.exists(DOCUMENTS_FOLDER):: This checks if your my_documents folder actually exists. If not, it shows an error in the app.
•	vector_store, embeddings = load_and_process_documents(...): This calls our function to get the documents ready.
•	if vector_store:: This makes sure that the document processing was successful before trying to set up the chatbot.
•	llm = ChatOllama(model=OLLAMA_MODEL, temperature=TEMPERATURE): Initializes our LLM. It connects to the Ollama server that's running in the background and specifies which model (like llama3) to use.
•	custom_prompt_template & CUSTOM_PROMPT: This is our instruction set for the LLM. It tells the LLM: "Here's some relevant context (from your documents) and a question. Use only this context to answer. If you can't find it, say you don't know." This is key to making a helpful RAG chatbot that doesn't "hallucinate" (make up false information).
•	qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(...): This is the core "chain" (or workflow) that brings RAG to life:
o	llm=llm: Specifies which LLM to use for generating the answer.
o	chain_type="stuff": This means that when relevant document chunks are found, they are "stuffed" (put directly) into the prompt that's sent to the LLM.
o	retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(): This is the "Retrieval" part. When a user asks a question, this component uses the vector_store (FAISS) to find the most relevant document chunks.
o	return_source_documents=True: This setting tells LangChain to also give us back the actual document chunks that were used, so we can show them to the user (for transparency).
•	user_question = st.text_input(...): Creates a text box on your web page where you can type your question.
•	if user_question:: When you type something and press Enter (or click away), this part of the code runs.
o	with st.spinner(...): Shows a "Searching and generating answer..." message while the chatbot is thinking.
o	result = qa_chain.invoke({"query": user_question}): This is where the magic happens!
1.	Your user_question is turned into an embedding.
2.	The retriever searches the vector_store (FAISS) for the most similar document chunks.
3.	These retrieved chunks are then passed along with your user_question to the llm (Ollama's llama3 model), following the CUSTOM_PROMPT instructions.
4.	The llm generates an answer.
o	st.subheader("Answer:") & st.write(result["result"]): Displays the chatbot's generated answer on your web page.
o	if result.get("source_documents"): ...: If the chain returned source documents, this code extracts their names and page numbers (if available for PDFs) and displays them, so you know where the information came from.
•	except Exception as e:: This is a basic error handling. If something goes wrong during the answer generation, it catches the error and displays a friendly message to you.
Step 5: Run Your Chatbot!
This is the exciting moment where you bring your chatbot to life.
1.	Critical Check: Is Ollama Running?
o	Your chatbot needs the Ollama server running in the background to talk to the llama3 LLM.
o	If you just installed Ollama, it likely started automatically.
o	If not, you can open a separate Terminal/Command Prompt (not your VS Code virtual environment terminal) and type: ollama serve and press Enter. Leave that terminal window open. Or, just running ollama run llama3 (and then /bye after it loads) will also ensure the server is active.
o	You MUST have the llama3 model downloaded via ollama run llama3 (from Step 1.2) before this step.
2.	Save Your Code: Make sure you've saved all your changes to the app.py file in VS Code (File > Save or Ctrl+S/Cmd+S).
3.	Ensure Virtual Environment is Active: Go back to your VS Code terminal. Confirm you see (venv) at the start of your command line. If not, reactivate it (from Step 0.5).
4.	Launch the Streamlit App: In your VS Code terminal (with (venv) active), type this command and press Enter:
Bash
streamlit run app.py
5.	Open in Browser: After a few moments, your web browser should automatically open a new tab, usually at http://localhost:8501. This is your very own AI chatbot!

Step 6: Interact with Your Chatbot (The Payoff!)
1.	Initial Loading: The very first time you run the app (or if you change the EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME), Streamlit will show messages about "Downloading and initializing embedding model..." and then "Loading and processing documents...". This means it's:
o	Downloading the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model (only once).
o	Reading all your documents from my_documents.
o	Breaking them into chunks.
o	Converting those chunks into numerical embeddings.
o	Storing those embeddings in the FAISS vector store. This can take a few minutes, especially for many documents or the first-time embedding model download. Be patient! You'll see messages like "Loaded X '.pdf' documents." and "Document embeddings created and stored..."
2.	Ready to Chat! Once you see "Document embeddings created and stored in FAISS vector store," the chatbot is ready.
3.	Type Your Question: In the text box on the web page, type a question related to the documents you put in your my_documents folder.
o	Example questions:
	"What is the summary of the project proposal?"
	"Can you list the ingredients for the banana bread recipe?"
	"What are the risks mentioned in the latest report?"
	"Who attended the meeting on [date]?"
4.	Get Your Answer: Press Enter or click outside the text box. The chatbot will then "think" (you'll see "Searching and generating answer..."), find the relevant parts of your documents, and use the llama3 LLM to generate an answer. It will also show you the file names and page numbers of the documents it used!
________________________________________
Congratulations! You've successfully built a local, open-source AI chatbot that can answer questions using your own documents. This is a significant achievement and a solid foundation for understanding many AI applications.
Remember:
•	Patience: AI tasks, especially local ones, can take time to process.
•	Resource Use: Keep an eye on your computer's performance. If it's slow, try a smaller Ollama model.
•	Experiment! Try different documents, different questions, and even play with CHUNK_SIZE and CHUNK_OVERLAP values to see how they affect the answers.
